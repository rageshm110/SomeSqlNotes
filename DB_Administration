installation decisions:
	Determine appropriate hardware
		> Virtualization VS hard

	CPU Sockets and Cores
	Memory
	DAS vs SAN
	Consider Solid State Storage
	Free, unsupported workloads SQLIO, SQLIOSIM

Select Appropriate Windows Operating System
	SQL Server is supported on windows server core

Editions
	Principle Editions
		Enterprise
		Buisness Intelligence
		Standard
		Evaluation

	Specialized Editions
		Web

	Breadth Editions
		Express
		Developer - Enterprise edition class features, no production connection


Default Instance/Named Instance
Each instances will have it's own set of services and service settings
Every single edition of sql server supports upto 50 instances

Collation
	Collation is a rule book of text based sorting and comparision rules.

		Collation can be set up at Database Leve and per column basis.

Design the storage for new databses
------------------------------------
	Drive Layout: Design Windows File Syatem for Expected I/O patterns.
	Consider Multiple file groups and Multiple Data File Designs.
	Table Partitioning Design.

	[We need to separate log file and data file activities]

	[Table and Indexes can be designated to a particular filegroup but not to a prticular file]

	Table Partitioning
		Table partitioning spreads data of a single table over multiple filegroups.
			purpose
				use more read/write heads to separate I/O activity over separate partition.
				efficiently load new dat into a large table.
				perform index maintenance on aprtition by partition basis.

Planning for GROWTH and CAPACITY
--------------------------------
	
	Growth Monitoring
		-Code and Agent Jobs
		- Performance Object Alert
		- Management Data Warehouse
		- Catalog Views and DMVs
			sys.database_files
			sys.dm_os_volume_stats
				SELECT db_name(f.database_id), f.file_id, volume_mount_point, (total_bytes/1073741824) AS TotalSizeGB, (available_bytes/1073741824) AS AvailableSizeGB
				FROM sys.master_files AS f  
				CROSS APPLY sys.dm_os_volume_stats(f.database_id, f.file_id); 
		- Stored Procedures
			sp_SpaceUsed
			sp_databases
		- DBCC sqlperf (logspace)


Maintaining Instances and Databases
	TDE - Transparent Data Encryption
		- Protecting Data in motion [SSL, TLS, IPSec]
		- Protecting data at rest [EFS, BitLocker, TDE]
	Provides realtime I/O encryptiona and decryption of the data and log filesin the event thet media is stolen.
	Protects data at rest in the event that data file, log file or backup is stolen
	Leverages the SQL server key hierarchy.

	Service Master Key
	Master Key
	Certificate
	Databse Key
